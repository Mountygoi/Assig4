First, we use a scanner to clarify the temperature of which city our user wants to know ( we need to write the name of the city in input), then we use our api key to create a connection with the openweather site, in the future we will take all the information from this site.  
Then we read the weather information output via bufferedreader and if the line is empty , we output an error . If the string is not empty, we read it and use our method called print Current Weather() , in this method we use a JSON library that formats json into plain text.  We use cout to output information , for example to find out the temperature cout to output information, for example to find out the temperature : System.out.println("Kazir neshe degree: " + (weather.getJSONObject("main").getInt("temp") - 273) + "â„ƒ");  here we write "main" because the "temp" command is in main, then we subtract -273 because openweather outputs us the temperature in kelvin format, and as we know kelvin is Celsius + 273.   That's how my code works.
